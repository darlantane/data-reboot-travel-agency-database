# Travel Agency Database

## Exercise

In this exercise, you will be working with a database for a travel agency.
They need you to write brand new functions to help them access their data faster and more efficiently.

Along the way, you will write functions that:

- give you access to specific data for a given city in the database
- allow you to update values for a given city in the database
- provide a list of nearby cities given a specific location

## Let's go

To start the exercise, open `travel_agency_database.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook` and follow the instructions.
